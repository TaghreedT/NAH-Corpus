# NAH_Hadith_Corpus
Non-authentic Hadith Corpus

* Arabic Hadith corpus

* It contains 452,624 words from different lesser-known Hadith books

* It also included several annotated Hadith books, which help to determine the switch points between the Isnad, the Matan,and the comment to provide a ground truth.

* Some of these books have both Hadiths (authentic and NAH), while others only contain NAH.

* The annotating process was done to determine eight primary features for each Hadith in this corpus:
    1. No.
    2. Full Hadith, 
    3. Isnad,
    4. Matan, 
    5. Authors Comments, 
    6. Hadith Type, 
    7. Authenticity  
    8. Topic.

* We will continue building and annotating this corpus, to add several Hadith books.
